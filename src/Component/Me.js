           Hi,IÂ´m Carlos...
            for many years I dedicated myself, as an actor and Teacher Drama, to
            the performing arts.Times of the pandemic, created
            the opportunity to try a positive evolution in my professional life.
            that is how I chose to apply to Henry Bootcamp where I spent more
            than 800 hours learning and codinng with a lot
            of commitment, responsibility and enthusiasm to learn to progress
            looking for a better future for me and my family. The first big
            goal, I achieved it. Today I am a Full-Stack developer who seeks to
            integrate an important professional team at the service of a company
            that faces new challenges to consolidate a progressive future where,
            from my place, will provide commitment, productive, responsible work,
            share, and learn to grow professionally. I consider myself a
            responsible, organized and proactive, with very good
            management of interpersonal relationships, predisposition for
            team work and challenges. I am interested in developing myself in
            dynamic environments that allow me to continue learning and continue
            developing the wonderful world of programming. Attitude, joy,
            enthusiasm and commitment to give the best of me, are my engines in
            this new stage of the search for a first opportunity, a job. There
            is still a lot ahead. Effort, collaboration and constant search for
            new solutions to improve people's lives through a responsible
            practice tailored to that end.
