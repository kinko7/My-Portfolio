Hi,IÂ´m Carlos Marleta...FullStack Developer Backend orinted.
for many years I dedicated myself, as an actor and Teacher Drama to
the performing arts.Times of pandemic, created
the opportunity to try a positive evolution in my professional life.
That is how I chose to apply to Henry Bootcamp where I spent more
than 800 hours learning and codinng with a lot
of commitment, responsibility and enthusiasm to learn to progress
looking for a better future for me and my family. The first big
goal, I achieved it. Today I am a Full-Stack developer who seeks to
integrate an important professional team at the service of a company
that faces new challenges to consolidate a progressive future where,
from my place, will provide commitment, responsible work,
and learn to grow professionally. I consider myself
organized and proactive, with good
management of interpersonal relationships, predisposition for
team work and challenges. I am interested in developing myself in
dynamic environments that allow me to continue learning and 
developing in the wonderful world of programming. Attitude, joy,
enthusiasm and commitment to give the best of me, are my engines in
this new stage of the search for a first opportunity, a job. There
is still a lot ahead. Effort, collaboration and constant search for
new solutions to improve people's lives through a responsible
practice tailored to that end.
